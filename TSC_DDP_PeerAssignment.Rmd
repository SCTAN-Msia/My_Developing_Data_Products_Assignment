## Introduction

In this assignment, I have created a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet and host my webpage on GitHub Pages. The webpage contains the date that I created the document, and a map created with Leaflet.

Welcome to my interactive map project created using R and Leaflet!

In this assignment, I’ve marked several meaningful locations around Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia:
- My **residential area**: *Bandar Utama 12*
- My **workplace**: *University of Malaya (UM)*
- The **city center** of *Kuala Lumpur*

These places reflect my everyday life — from where I live, to where I work, to the vibrant city and state I’m proud to be part of. Scroll down to explore the map and click on each point to learn more!


### Installation
To use Leaflet in R, install the package (if you haven’t already):

```r
install.packages("leaflet")
```

### My First Leaflet Map: Create an interactive map using Leaflet in R that marks 3 of my favorite locations.
```r
library(leaflet)

# Updated data frame without state
my_places <- data.frame(
  name = c("🏡 Bandar Utama 12 — My neighborhood",
           "<b>🏢 University of Malaya — My workplace</b><br><a href='https://www.um.edu.my' target='_blank'>Visit UM Website</a>",
           "🌆 Kuala Lumpur City Center"),
  lat = c(3.1387, 3.1205, 3.1390),
  lng = c(101.6158, 101.6544, 101.6869)
)

# Leaflet map with clustering and rectangle
leaflet(data = my_places) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addMarkers(~lng, ~lat, popup = ~name,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             popupOptions = popupOptions(maxWidth = 300)) %>%
  
  # Add rectangle around Bandar Utama 12
  addRectangles(
    lng1 = 101.6125, lat1 = 3.1360,  # Southwest corner
    lng2 = 101.6190, lat2 = 3.1410,  # Northeast corner
    fillColor = "blue",
    fillOpacity = 0.1,
    color = "blue",
    weight = 2,
    popup = "📦 Area: Bandar Utama 12"
  )
  
```

### This is my Output
```{r}
library(leaflet)

# Updated data frame without state
my_places <- data.frame(
  name = c("🏡 Bandar Utama 12 — My neighborhood",
           "<b>🏢 University of Malaya — My workplace</b><br><a href='https://www.um.edu.my' target='_blank'>Visit UM Website</a>",
           "🌆 Kuala Lumpur City Center"),
  lat = c(3.1387, 3.1205, 3.1390),
  lng = c(101.6158, 101.6544, 101.6869)
)

# Leaflet map with clustering and rectangle
leaflet(data = my_places) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addMarkers(~lng, ~lat, popup = ~name,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             popupOptions = popupOptions(maxWidth = 300)) %>%
  
  # Add rectangle around Bandar Utama 12
  addRectangles(
    lng1 = 101.6125, lat1 = 3.1360,  # Southwest corner
    lng2 = 101.6190, lat2 = 3.1410,  # Northeast corner
    fillColor = "blue",
    fillOpacity = 0.1,
    color = "blue",
    weight = 2,
    popup = "📦 Area: Bandar Utama 12"
  )
```
